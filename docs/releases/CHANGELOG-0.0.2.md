- Microphone permission required and clearly requested
- Speech recognition respects browser privacy settings
- No voice data storage or transmission

**Performance Impact:**

- Minimal memory footprint (~5MB additional for voice processing)
- No impact on desktop performance when not actively listening
- Efficient resource cleanup prevents memory leaks
- Lazy loading of speech recognition APIs

This release significantly enhances the authenticity and accessibility of the Fugir desktop experience by introducing natural voice interaction capabilities, making the environment more immersive and user-friendly for all users.
